SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.

Enter Hostess and SLY
SLY
I'll pheeze you, in faith.
Hostess
A pair of stocks, you rogue!
SLY
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
Hostess

SLY
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
Page
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
SLY
What, household stuff?
